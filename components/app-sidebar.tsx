/**
 * What a phone's tab bar offers, in preference order.
 *
 * A phone does not get this sidebar. It gets four destinations across the bottom of
 * the screen plus a "More" button that opens the sidebar in a drawer — because a
 * sidebar is a poor fit for the shape of the device and worse for the shape of an
 * installed app. It is twenty-odd rows deep, which on a phone is a full screen and a
 * half; it sits behind a control in the TOP-LEFT corner, the hardest place on a
 * handset to reach; and every navigation costs two taps. In a standalone PWA there is
 * also no browser chrome to fall back on, so a menu you cannot reach is a dead end
 * rather than an inconvenience.
 *
 * Four is the count both platforms' own tab bars settle on once a "More" affordance
 * takes the fifth slot, and it is about as many labels as fit legibly across a narrow
 * screen.
 *
 * The list is a PREFERENCE, not a fixed bar: entries the user cannot see are dropped
 * (same canSee as the sidebar — the tab bar must not offer a page whose every request
 * 403s), and the bar is then topped up from the rest of NAV_ITEMS so a fund running an
 * unusual mix of features still gets a full bar rather than two tabs and a gap.
