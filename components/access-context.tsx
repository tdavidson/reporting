'use client'

// The client's view of what the signed-in user may reach.
//
// It carries the resolver's INPUTS (role, feature switches, grants, defaults) rather than a
// precomputed answer per domain, and runs the very same `effectiveAccess` the server does. That
// isn't purity for its own sake — a precomputed map has to pick one feature key per domain, and
// several domains span more than one (`relationships` covers interactions AND notes;
// `lp_capital` covers lps AND lp_tracking). Collapsing them made the nav hide pages the user could
// actually open, because it answered a question nobody asked.
//
// Client-side checks are for AFFORDANCES ONLY — showing a panel, keeping a nav item. Nothing here
// is a security boundary: the middleware gates every API call against the same resolver, so hiding
// a control only spares the user something that would 403. That is the point of the split, and it
// is why "hidden = gone from the sidebar, still reachable by URL" was a bug rather than a feature.
