/**
 * The ONE investment-transaction form.
 *
 * It grew up inside the company page's Investment Details section, and for a long time that was
 * the only place a transaction could be recorded. /start now offers "Add investment" as well, and
 * the temptation was a second, smaller form for the common case. Resisted: every rule in here —
 * which terms an instrument has, what a conversion carries, what a split restates, when nothing
 * reaches the ledger and why — was learned the hard way once, and a second form would have to
 * learn it all again. So the form is a component of its own, with no dialog chrome and no
 * knowledge of where it is rendered; the company page wraps it in an Add/Edit dialog, and /start
 * puts a company picker in front of it.
 *
 * What it needs from its host is the company's existing transactions and summary (for round-name
 * suggestions, the "Converts from" picker, and FX seeding) and the fund's lot policy. What it
 * hands back is the API's response — the saved row plus `ledger`, which says whether a journal
 * entry was drafted. `LedgerSaveNote` below renders that answer; both hosts show it.
