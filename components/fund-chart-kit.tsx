/**
 * The shared vocabulary for fund charts — the card, the axis/tooltip styling, and the palette.
 *
 * These lived as module-private constants inside fund-detail-view.tsx, which was fine while that
 * page was the only one plotting anything. Portfolio construction plots the same quantities
 * (invested capital, proceeds, gains) and would otherwise pick its own hues for them, so the two
 * pages would drift into saying "invested capital" in two colours. Extracted rather than copied:
 * one definition is the only way that stays true.
 *
 * The palette itself is NOT chosen here — it is the app's categorical ramp from globals.css,
 * validated with the dataviz checker against both surfaces. Read the note above `--cat-1` there
 * before adding a slot: the adjacent pairlist (stacks, bars) clears all eight, but all-pairs
 * forms (pie, scatter) clear only four, which is why `SLICE` is four long and folds to muted.
