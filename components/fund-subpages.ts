/** The static subpage slugs under a fund — anything else in the `/funds/<x>` slot is a

 *  Lives in a plain (non-`'use client'`) module so both the server fund-detail page and the
 *  client sidebar can import it. Exporting a `Set` from a client module turns it into a
 *  client-reference proxy on the server, so calling `.has()` there throws
 *  "Attempted to call has() from the server but has is on the client". */
