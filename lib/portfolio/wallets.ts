// Watched wallets: what the chain says a fund holds, checked against what its books say.
//
// THE POINT OF THIS FILE IS THE DISAGREEMENT. A quoted equity gets its quantity from the fund's
// own trade records and there is nothing to reconcile against. A token does not: the address is
// a second, independent source of truth for the quantity, and it is the only asset class in
// this book where an outside party can check the position without being shown anything.
//
// So the observed balance NEVER becomes the carrying quantity. If it did, the two sources would
// be one source and the check would be gone — an unrecorded disposal would silently restate the
// position instead of raising its hand. The books stay the books; this reports the variance.
//
// Pure, and shaped like fof-valuation.ts and quotes.ts so the close splices it into the same
// blockers/warnings arrays.

 * transfer between two of the fund's own wallets, an airdrop nobody has decided how to treat,
 * a staking reward still accruing — all produce a variance that a fund can look at and
 * reasonably decide to close over. Blocking would make an ordinary week unclosable and would
 * train people to ignore it. What it must do is be impossible to miss, with both numbers and
 * the direction stated, so the decision is a decision rather than an oversight.
 *
 * An UNOBSERVED wallet warns too: the fund attached an address and then never read it, which
 * means the position is being reported on the books' word alone — exactly the situation the
 * wallet was supposed to improve on.
 *
 * An UNVERIFIED wallet warns once per holding. A watched address proves a balance, not control,
 * and an auditor will ask. Warning rather than blocking because proving control is a task with
 * a human in it, and a fund should not be locked out of its own close over paperwork.
