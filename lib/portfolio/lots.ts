// Cost basis on a partial disposal.
//
// Selling part of a fungible position needs to know WHICH purchase the units left, and the
// answer is a policy election rather than a fact. The fund picks a method; this applies it.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not overwrite `cost_basis_exited`. The recorded figure is what
// the books use, here as everywhere — a fund may have a reason for a number this cannot infer,
// and silently restating a realised gain because a policy field said so would be a worse bug
// than the one this fixes. It PROPOSES a basis for a new disposal, and it RECONCILES the ones
// already recorded, so a disagreement is visible instead of assumed away.
//
// Lots are built from SPLIT-ADJUSTED transactions, so a lot bought before a 2-for-1 holds twice
// the units at half the cost per unit and the same total cost. Without that, a disposal after a
// split consumes the wrong number of lots and lands on the wrong basis.
