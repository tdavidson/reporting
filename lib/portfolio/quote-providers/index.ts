// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Where quotes come from.
//
// NO LIVE VENDOR IS WIRED UP, deliberately. Prices are entered by hand today, which is a
// perfectly good answer for a handful of positions and costs nothing to run or audit. What
// exists here is the SEAM: the shape an adapter has to satisfy, and the one place it registers.
//
// ADDING A VENDOR is a new file and a line in PROVIDERS below. Nothing else changes — not the
// schema, not the close, not the valuation. `price_feeds.provider` already stores which adapter
// a feed uses, `price_observations` already records where each stored price came from, and
// /api/accounting/price-feeds already has a `sync-now` action that calls whatever is registered.
//
// The candidates worth looking at, and what each is good for:
//   - Massive (massive.com) — what Polygon.io became. Daily closes plus a corporate-actions
//     feed, which is the piece that would let a split be DETECTED rather than typed in.
//   - EOD Historical Data — broad global exchange coverage, so a London or Euronext listing
//     works with the MIC and the GBp quote_scale the feed already carries.
//   - CoinGecko or similar for digital assets, which are a different market and a different
//     vendor from listed equities.
//
// An adapter must satisfy exactly one rule beyond the interface: it returns a price and the
// date that price belongs to, and NOTHING else. Scaling, FX, lock-up discounts and ASC 820
// leveling all live in lib/portfolio/quotes.ts. A provider that starts adjusting prices is a
// second, drifted copy of the valuation rules, and the whole point of this boundary is that
// there cannot be one.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
