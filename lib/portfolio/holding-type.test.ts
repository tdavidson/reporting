/**
 * A fund-of-funds holding lives in `companies` behind a `holding_type` discriminator, so
 * every COMPANY-SHAPED surface has to exclude funds or it silently starts showing them:
 * founder-email routing, sector/stage charts, default-metric seeding, LP letter aggregation.
 *
 * This exists for the same reason lib/design-tokens.test.ts and lib/access/route-domains.test.ts
 * do: the failure is invisible in review and obvious in production. A new `.from('companies')`
 * list query must either filter holding_type or be allowlisted WITH a reason.
