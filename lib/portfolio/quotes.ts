// Quoted positions — period-end valuation from an observable price, and the ASC 820 level
// that price earns.
//
// Deliberately PURE, and deliberately shaped like lib/portfolio/fof-valuation.ts: the close
// loads the inputs and splices the result into its existing blockers/warnings arrays. A fund
// of funds derives its mark from a manager NAV rolled forward; a quoted holding derives its
// mark from a price on a date. Same question, same answer shape, same place in the close.
//
// NO VALUATION MATH IS REIMPLEMENTED HERE. A quoted position is quantity x price, which is
// exactly computeSummary's priced-equity path, so a booked quote is an ordinary
// `unrealized_gain_change` carrying `current_share_price` and everything downstream — the
// schedule of investments, the statements, the per-company tie-out — reads it without
// knowing a feed exists. What this file adds is which price, on which date, and at what level.
