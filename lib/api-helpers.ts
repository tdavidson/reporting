 * feature switch plus the caller's per-domain grant, resolved in one place
 * (lib/access/effective.ts) and enforced on EVERY /api request by the middleware — which knows
 * this route's domain, as this helper never could.
 *
 * Keeping the old check made nothing safer; it made the grants a LIE. An admin could set Fund
 * accounting to "Members", grant someone read, and watch every route 403 them anyway — while that
 * same person read the books through the Analyst and MCP, which had already moved to the real
 * resolver. A second, coarser, contradictory policy is not defence in depth. It is a bug that
 * only ever fires on the people you meant to let in.
 *
 * Retired only AFTER the domain gate's own leaks were closed — see docs/plan-access-control.md →
 * Sequencing. Ordering mattered: removing this while the replacement still leaked would have left
 * a window where neither policy was correct.
