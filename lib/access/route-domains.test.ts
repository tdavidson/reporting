/**
 * The coverage test — the reason this access model will still be true in a year.
 *
 * 137 of 263 API routes shipped with no role check at all. Not one of them decided to skip it;
 * nothing asked. So the rule is enforced here rather than left to reviewers: every route under
 * app/api is either mapped to a domain in ROUTE_DOMAINS, or listed in UNGATED_ROUTES with a
 * reason. A new route that does neither fails CI, and the failure message says what to do.
 *
 * If this test is in your way: the answer is to add your route to one of the two maps, not to
 * add an exception here.
 *
 * See plans/plan-access-control.md.
