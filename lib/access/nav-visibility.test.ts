/**
 * The nav must answer the SAME question the API answers.
 *
 * It gets its own test because the two drifted once already, in both directions: the sidebar used
 * to consult only the fund-level switch (so it offered links whose APIs 403ed, and hid nothing
 * from anyone who knew the URL), and then briefly consulted a per-domain map that had collapsed
 * each domain to a single feature key (so it hid pages the user could open and whose API returned
 * 200).
 *
 * These pin the resolver behaviour the sidebar's `canSee` depends on — specifically for the nav
 * entries whose own featureKey differs from their domain's primaryFeature, which is exactly where
 * the collapse bit.
