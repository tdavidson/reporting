// Pure metadata for the PORTFOLIO agent tools — companies, investments, performance,
// LPs. NO server imports, so this is safe in client components (the Settings key UI
// lists it). Handlers live in portfolio-tools.ts.
//
// These are fund-scoped, not vehicle-scoped: a company can sit in more than one
// vehicle, and "how is the portfolio doing" is a question about the fund. Ledger tools
// are the opposite — every one of them operates on a single set of books. That's the
// `domain` flag, and it's why the dispatcher only injects a `vehicle` argument into
// ledger tools.
