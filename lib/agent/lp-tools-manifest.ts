// Pure metadata for the LP REPORTING agent tools. NO server imports (the Settings key UI
// lists these). Handlers live in lp-tools.ts.
//
// THE THING TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE READING THESE: the fund has TWO producers of LP figures,
// with identical row shapes and different meanings.
//
//   • A SNAPSHOT (`lp_snapshots` + `lp_investments`) is a frozen, hand-imported
//     spreadsheet: what the administrator reported as of a date. Immutable by convention.
//   • The LIVE report is derived from the books on demand, as of any date, and is never
//     written down.
//
// They can disagree, and when they do that disagreement is itself the interesting fact —
// it is a reconciliation break. So no tool here quietly picks one for you: `lp_snapshot`
// reads the stored figures, `lp_live_report` derives them, and `lp_reconcile_snapshot`
// diffs the two. A single `get_lp_numbers` tool would have to choose, and would be wrong
// half the time without saying so.
