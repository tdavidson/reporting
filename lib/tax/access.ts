/**
 * A K-1 package structurally contains the carry.
 *
 * The K-1 routes are registered under `lp_capital` — correctly: their payload is per-partner
 * figures. But one of the partners is the GP entity, and the GP entity's K-1 IS the carried
 * interest by another name: `k1-load.ts` reads each partner's `carriedInterest` off the same
 * roll-forward that `capital-accounts` withholds from callers without `gp_economics`, the
 * allocation moves it onto the recipient's lines, and `section1061Recharacterized` (box 20AH) is
 * by definition the carry recipient's recharacterised gain. Serving that under `lp_capital` alone
 * would hand a member holding only the partner register the fund's carry economics — the exact
 * carve-out `gp_economics` exists to keep.
 *
 * Gated whole rather than redacted. `capital-accounts` drops one line for callers without the
 * grant and the row still reads; a K-1 package with the GP's row removed does not foot, and one
 * with box 20AH removed misstates the recipient's gain. "We tried gating those payloads field by
 * field. It doesn't hold" — DOMAIN_META.lp_capital says so about the ledger, and it is true of a
 * K-1 package for the same reason. So: preparing or reading K-1s requires being allowed to see
 * the carry, because K-1s contain it. Same shape as `/api/accounting/statements` gating the
 * partners' capital section in-handler (CLAUDE.md, "the registry maps ONE domain per route").
 *
 * Returns the 403 to send, or null to proceed.
