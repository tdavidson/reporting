/**
 * Resolve a vehicle name against the fund's canonical vehicle list. An explicit name is matched
 * case-insensitively (while returning the stored spelling); an omitted name is only valid for a
 * single-vehicle fund.
 *
 * MANAGEMENT COMPANIES ARE EXCLUDED UNLESS ASKED FOR, and that default is a security boundary
 * rather than a tidiness one.
 *
 * This function is where every vehicle-scoped surface in the app turns a name into a ledger: the 57
 * accounting routes, the MCP tools, the Analyst's accounting context, the pending-action builders,
 * the construction service. All of them are gated on the `accounting` grant, and a management
 * company's books sit in the same tables as a fund's — so any of them, handed a manco's name, would
 * have served the firm's payroll to whoever could reconcile a bank account.
 *
 * Resolving against `listVehicles` (which omits mancos) means every one of those callers refuses a
 * management company by DEFAULT, without having been changed and without having to remember. Only a
 * caller that has actually checked the `management_company` grant opts in, by passing
 * `includeManagementCompanies` — and today there are exactly two, both in http-vehicle.ts, both of
 * which run the check immediately afterwards.
 *
 * The failure mode when a caller forgets is "unknown vehicle", not "here is the payroll".
