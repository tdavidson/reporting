// PURE. No I/O, no Supabase, and no clock except the `today` a caller passes in. That is
// deliberate and load-bearing: the SAME function runs on the server (to seed the page) and in
// the browser (on every keystroke), so a GP twiddling a check size gets an instant answer
// instead of a round trip. It also means the arithmetic is pinned by unit tests rather than by
// a screenshot.
//
// WHAT IS DERIVED vs WHAT IS STATED. `ConstructionActuals` is what the system knows — committed
// capital from the commitment events, fees and expenses INCURRED from the ledger, capital
// deployed from the portfolio tracker. `ConstructionAssumptions` is what the GP states about the
// future. The two never mix: nothing a user types can move a derived number.
//
// NOT the ledger forecast (plans/plan-forecast.md). That compiles hypotheticals into journal
// postings so the statements forecast themselves. Construction never touches a journal — nobody
// is asking for a forecast balance sheet here — so it is deliberately built apart from it.

/**
 * Where the forecasted total value COMES FROM — the three sources that add up to it.
 *
 * `forecastedTotalValue` is one number on the page, and one number cannot say whether a 3x fund
 * is 3x because a company already exited, because a lot of cost is sitting at carrying value, or
 * because the forecast is asking for a large gain that has not happened yet. Those are very
 * different plans. This splits it:
 *
 *   realizedProceeds  cash already back from exits and secondaries
 *   investedAtWork    cost basis still deployed or committed to a plan — the part that is not gain
 *   forecastGain      what the forecast asks the remaining book to add on top of that cost
 *
 * The three sum to `forecastedTotalValue` by construction, so a chart of them can never disagree
 * with the MOIC printed beside it. An exited company appears ONLY in realizedProceeds: its cost
 * is not at work any more, and counting it again would double it against a forecast it no longer
 * has (`estimatedReturn` is null for an exited row).
 *
 * `forecastGain` is signed. A marked-down book returns a negative number rather than a floored
 * zero — the caller decides how to draw that; the model does not misreport the direction.
