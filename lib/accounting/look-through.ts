// Associates look-through: attributing a GP/associate vehicle's position in the fund back to
// its own members.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. `lp_associates_overrides` stored, per (investor, associates entity), an
// `ownership_pct` and a `carried_interest_pct` — as FREE TEXT names that had to match an
// investor's name AND a portfolio_group string simultaneously. Rename anything and the
// look-through silently stopped matching. It pro-rated everything by ownership and then netted
// carry off NAV, which conflates two different economics.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. An associate vehicle keeps its own books. Its members' commitments
// and capital accounts are IN THE LEDGER, so ownership is derived, not maintained. And carry is
// treated as what it is — a separate entitlement:
//
//   ownership  — each member's share of the associate's CAPITAL. Derived from their commitments
//                (or capital balances) in the associate vehicle.
//   carry      — each member's share of the associate's CARRIED INTEREST. A separate allocation
//                (partner_allocation_terms, category 'carried_interest'), because carry points
//                routinely diverge from committed capital — and a member can hold carry points
//                while committing NOTHING at all.
//
// The split is possible because the close now accrues carry into the GP partner's
// `carriedInterest` roll-forward bucket (see carry.ts). The associate's position in the fund is
// therefore already separated into "capital I contributed and its returns" and "carry I earned",
// and each half goes to the people entitled to it.
