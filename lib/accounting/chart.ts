/**
 * Starter chart for a MANAGEMENT COMPANY — the firm's operating entity, as opposed to any
 * fund it manages.
 *
 * A manco is a normal business that happens to have one customer per fund. Its revenue is the
 * management fee, its costs are people and offices, and its balance sheet is mostly cash,
 * receivables from the funds, and what it owes its staff. None of the fund chart applies: there
 * are no investments at cost, no unrealized appreciation, no partners' capital per LP, no
 * schedule of investments, and nothing to allocate to anybody. Seeding DEFAULT_CHART on a manco
 * (what happened before `kind = 'manco'` existed) offers all of that and offers no salaries
 * account at all, which is the one line that matters most.
 *
 * Three deliberate choices, since a chart is mostly a set of decisions about what to keep apart:
 *
 * 1. COMPENSATION IS FOUR ACCOUNTS, not one. Salaries, employer payroll taxes, benefits and
 *    incentive compensation behave differently, are budgeted separately, and are asked about
 *    separately ("what does a head cost us?" is 5000+5010+5020; "what did we pay out on last
 *    year's performance?" is 5030). Rolling them together destroys all three answers and cannot
 *    be undone from the ledger afterwards.
 *
 * 2. THE FEE IS BILLED BEFORE IT IS EARNED, so 2400 exists. Management fees are almost always
 *    charged quarterly IN ADVANCE: the cash lands on 1 January for a quarter that has not
 *    happened. Recognising all of it as January income overstates Q1 revenue by two thirds and
 *    understates the liability to the fund by the same amount. 2400 holds the unearned part and
 *    releases it monthly, which is also what makes the quarterly revenue cycle on the manco
 *    dashboard mean anything.
 *
 * 3. INTERCOMPANY IS TWO ACCOUNTS AND THEY NEVER NET. 1200 is what the funds owe the manco, 2300
 *    is what the manco owes them (an expense it paid on their behalf, an advance). Presenting the
 *    net is how an intercompany balance stops reconciling: the two sides are with different
 *    counterparties, settle on different dates, and each has to agree to a matching payable or
 *    receivable on another entity's books. lib/accounting/intercompany.ts posts both sides of
 *    every charge against exactly these codes.
