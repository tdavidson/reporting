/**
 * WHICH GRANT A REQUEST FOR A VEHICLE'S BOOKS NEEDS — decided by the vehicle, not by the route.
 *
 * Every other gate in this app answers "may this caller call this route?" and the answer is the
 * same for every row the route can reach. Accounting is the one place that isn't true. A
 * management company's ledger is stored in the same `journal_entries`, `journal_postings` and
 * `chart_of_accounts` tables as every fund's, distinguished only by `vehicle_id` — so
 * `/api/accounting/journal?group=<the manco>` is, to the middleware, the same request as
 * `?group=<Fund II>`. It resolves `accounting`, sees a grant, and hands back the firm's payroll.
 *
 * That is the hole this closes. `resolveGroupOr400` — which all 90-odd accounting call sites
 * already use to work out WHICH vehicle they are serving — now also decides whether this caller
 * may serve it. One choke point, no per-route decision to forget.
 *
 * THE RULE, stated in full:
 *
 *   - An ordinary vehicle (fund / SPV / direct / associate / other) needs `accounting`, which the
 *     middleware has already checked by the time a handler runs. Nothing extra happens, and
 *     nothing extra is loaded — the common path costs one column of one row.
 *   - A management company needs `management_company` AS WELL, at the same level the route
 *     declared. The conjunction is deliberate, and it errs safe: `accounting` alone can never
 *     reach a manco, which is the whole point of splitting the domain.
 *
 * The cost of the conjunction is that a manco-only bookkeeper cannot use the shared ledger pages
 * (journal, bank, QuickBooks) — those sit behind `/api/accounting/*`, which the middleware gates on
 * `accounting` before any of this runs. The manco module's OWN routes (`/api/manco/*`) are gated on
 * `management_company` alone and cover the dashboard, the chart, the statements and intercompany,
 * so that person has a working section; they need the fund-accounting grant only to hand-author
 * journal entries. Widening that means either moving the manco ledger into its own tables or
 * teaching the middleware to read the vehicle out of a request body — neither is worth doing to
 * save a grant, and the failure mode of getting it wrong is disclosing compensation.
