// Capital-account roll-forward — the core fund-accounting artifact.
//
// Each LP's capital account is one equity account; the roll-forward lines come
// from the source_type of the entries that touch it. LP capital is credit-normal,
// so a posting's contribution to capital is the NEGATED signed amount (a credit,
// which is negative in debit-positive convention, increases capital).
//
//   ending = beginning + contributions + distributions + managementFees + expenses
//          + operatingIncome + realizedGains + unrealizedGains + transfers
//          + carriedInterest + unclassified
//
// contributions are positive; distributions/fees/expenses/carry are negative;
// income, gains and transfers are signed. `ending` is computed as the RAW SUM of
// capital deltas, never from the buckets — so it always ties to the ledger no
// matter how lines are categorized. That invariant is what makes re-bucketing safe.
//
// PERIODS. Passing a { start, end } window turns this into a period statement:
// `beginning` becomes the capital balance carried in from before `start`, the
// activity lines cover only the window, and `ending` is the balance as of `end`.
// With no window it's the inception-to-date view, where `beginning` holds only
// explicit opening_balance entries. Both satisfy the same tie-out identity.
