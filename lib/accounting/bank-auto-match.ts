// Match a bank transaction to the partner whose declared call or distribution it settles.
//
// The settlement entries already exist and are correct (`buildFundingEntry` for a call,
// `buildDistributionSettlementEntry` for a distribution). What was missing is knowing WHICH
// partner a wire belongs to without being told. This decides that, and — just as importantly
// — decides when it cannot be decided.
//
// TWO SIGNALS, AND BOTH MATTER:
//
//   amount — an open balance equal to the transaction. On its own this is often ambiguous:
//            partners frequently hold identical commitments, so several can owe or be owed
//            exactly the same figure.
//   name   — the partner's name appearing in the bank description. Bank wires carry it
//            ("WIRED FUNDS SENT BENE: <name> ACCT: …"), and it is what resolves the ties
//            that amount alone cannot.
//
// The rule is deliberately conservative: auto-match only when the two signals agree on ONE
// partner. A wrong guess here moves someone else's money in the books, and a human glancing
// at a reconciled row has no reason to re-check it. Ambiguity is returned, not resolved.
