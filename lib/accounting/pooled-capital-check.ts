// Detect LP capital stranded on the pooled "Partners' capital — LP (unallocated)" account.

// The capital-account roll-forward attributes a posting to a partner only when the posting
// AND the account it lands on both carry an lp_entity_id (load.ts:107-126). A vehicle
// onboarded before its per-LP capital accounts existed books everything to the pooled 3100
// instead, so every capital posting is silently discarded: Called, Beginning and Ending all
// read 0 while Committed — which never touches the ledger — reads correctly.
//
// That state is indistinguishable from "this vehicle has no capital yet" unless something
// goes looking, which is why Ocrolus SPV LP sat wrong from 2020 to 2026 with a $316k
// overstatement on the balance sheet. This is the something.
