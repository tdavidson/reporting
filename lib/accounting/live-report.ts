// The live LP capital report — the second way to produce an LP aggregated capital report.
//
// The existing way is a SNAPSHOT: someone imports a spreadsheet and `lp_investments` rows
// are frozen at that moment. This way derives the same figures from whatever the vehicle's
// books say right now, as of any date, for BOTH kinds of vehicle:
//
//   ledger vehicles — posted journal postings on LP capital accounts
//   events vehicles — lp_capital_events, the lightweight LP-facing leg
//
// The rows this emits are shaped EXACTLY like `lp_investments` rows (one per entity per
// vehicle, same column names, same units). That is the whole trick: every existing consumer
// — portal overview, investor report PDF, Excel export, the GP snapshot page, the LP
// analyst — already knows how to aggregate rows of that shape across vehicles, through
// investor parents, and through associates look-through. Emitting the same shape means the
// live path inherits all of it instead of reimplementing it.
//
// It does NOT write anything. A live report is computed and thrown away; the stored
// snapshots stay exactly as they are, which is what makes the two comparable.
