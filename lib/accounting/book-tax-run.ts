// part of the three that touches a database, which is why the other two can be tested exhaustively
// without one.
//
// RE-RUNNABLE, on the close's pattern. Every entry carries `source_ref = tax:<year>`, so a re-run
// voids exactly what the last run wrote before writing again — the alternative is a second full
// set against the same year, silently doubling every adjustment. Hand-authored tax entries have no
// such source_ref and are never touched, which is the whole reason a fund can correct what this
// proposes.
