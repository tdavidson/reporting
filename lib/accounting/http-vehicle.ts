 * Resolve the vehicle (portfolio_group) for a request AND check the caller may have it: the
 * explicit value, or the fund's sole vehicle. Returns a NextResponse when it's ambiguous/missing
 * (400) or when the vehicle belongs to a domain this caller doesn't hold (403).
 *
 * The access check lives here rather than in each route because this is the one line every
 * accounting route already has. `/api/accounting/*` is gated on `accounting` by the middleware,
 * which is the right answer for a fund vehicle and the wrong one for a management company — a
 * manco's ledger is in the same tables, so that grant would serve the firm's payroll to anyone who
 * can reconcile a bank account. `assertVehicleDomain` is what makes the `management_company`
 * domain mean something; see lib/accounting/vehicle-domain.ts for the full rule.
 *
 * It takes the whole gate, not just `fundId`, because the check needs to know who is asking and at
 * what level — and a signature that can't be called without them is the only version a new route
 * cannot get wrong.

 * grant says nothing about which vehicle they named, and without this a manco route would read a
 * fund's books for someone who was never given the `accounting` grant. Same hole, other direction.
 *
 * A manco is never the fund's "sole vehicle" in any interesting case, so `requested` is required
 * here rather than defaulted: silently resolving to whatever single vehicle exists would, on a
 * fund that has no manco at all, produce a confusing 400 about the wrong vehicle.
