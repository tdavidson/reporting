// Charges between two vehicles of the same firm — the management fee a fund owes the management
// company, a cost one entity paid on another's behalf, an advance between them.
//
// WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE AND NOT TWO JOURNAL ENTRIES.
//
// An intercompany charge is one economic fact and two ledgers. Booked as two ordinary journal
// entries, nothing in the system knows they are the same charge: the manco's receivable and the
// fund's payable are independent numbers that agree only for as long as both were typed correctly,
// and when they stop agreeing there is no way to tell which one moved. That is the classic
// intercompany failure, and it is discovered at audit.
//
// So a charge is a row (`intercompany_transactions`), and posting it writes BOTH sides in one
// action, each entry tagged `source_ref = 'intercompany:<id>'` — the same convention the period
// close uses to find the entries it wrote. The row keeps the two entry ids as well, so the
// reconciliation is a lookup in either direction rather than a join on a memo string.
//
// WHAT IS NOT HERE: the BALANCE. The outstanding due-from/due-to per counterparty is read off the
// ledger (`intercompanyBalances` below), not summed from these rows. A register that computed its
// own balance would disagree with the balance sheet the first time anyone posted a correcting
// entry by hand, and nothing would say which was right. The ledger is the answer; this table is
// the story of how it got there.
