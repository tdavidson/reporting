/**
 * The management company's QuickBooks import.
 *
 * A manco's general ledger is mostly compensation and occupancy — none of which has an analogue on
 * a fund's chart. Before these rules existed the mapping screen offered `confidence: 'none'` for
 * essentially every expense account, which is not wrong (a human confirms every proposal) but
 * makes importing a firm's history twenty dropdowns of manual work.
 *
 * The mechanism worth pinning is that NO rule here is chart-kind aware: a rule whose subtype is
 * absent from the vehicle's chart is skipped, so the same keyword table serves both charts and a
 * manco rule can never fire on a fund.
