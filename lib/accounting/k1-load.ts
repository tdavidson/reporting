// Reading a vehicle's tax year into the two inputs the K-1 allocation needs.
//
// k1-allocation.ts is pure and knows nothing about a database. This is the part that does: it
// loads each partner's capital activity on a TAX basis, and the fund's income by character, and
// hands both over.
//
// THE CROSS-BOOK READ. Everything else in this codebase reads the actual book alone. This does
// not, and it is the first place that legitimately shouldn't: a tax-basis capital account is
// `actual + tax adjustments`, which is the whole point of the overlay. The read is registered in
// books.test.ts's exemption list with that reason, so it stays a decision rather than an
// oversight.
