// Interest accrued on convertible notes.
//
// A note earns interest whether or not anyone books it. Not accruing it understates the fund's
// income and the position's carrying value — and then at conversion the interest silently
// appears inside the equity's cost basis with no record of where it came from.
//
// SAME SHAPE AS THE CARRY ACCRUAL (carry.ts): compute a TARGET from the terms and the time
// elapsed, compare it to what the ledger already carries, post the delta. Recomputing the target
// from scratch each close makes the accrual self-correcting — fix a wrong rate, and the next
// close repairs the balance rather than compounding the mistake.
//
// Dr 1150-<company> Accrued interest   (asset, per company)
// Cr 4100          Interest and dividend income
//
// INCOME, NOT A MARK. Interest a note genuinely earned is investment income; a valuation change
// is not. They belong on different lines, for the same reason FX does — an LP must be able to
// tell what the portfolio did from what the terms did. `4100` buckets to `operatingIncome` in the
// capital-account roll-forward, exactly as it should.
