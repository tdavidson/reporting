// The tax package: one ZIP per entity per year with everything a preparer asks for, built from
// pieces the caller has already produced. Pure apart from the zip itself, so the manifest and the
// README can be tested without a database or a browser.
//
// Stateless by decision (plans/plan-accounting-workflow.md): the package is deterministic from
// the ledger as of the closed period, so it is rebuilt on every request and nothing is logged.
