 * This is the invariant that stops a vehicle name from ever being a disconnected string: every write
 * path that stores one (company save, investment save, import) calls this first, so the registry is
 * always the source of truth and the stored `portfolio_group` string is a projection of a real
 * vehicle. Empty/blank input creates nothing — a company or investment may have NO vehicle.
