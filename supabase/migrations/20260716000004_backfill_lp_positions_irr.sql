-- Backfill lp_positions.irr from the snapshots the positions were migrated from.
--
-- lp_positions was backfilled from every snapshot's lp_investments (20260716000000), but the
-- irr column didn't exist yet (added in 20260716000002), so the reported IRR each snapshot
-- carried never came across. IRR is NOT derivable from a single dated position, so a
-- single-cutover tracking vehicle shows a blank IRR unless the stored figure is present — which
-- is exactly the gap here.
--
-- Copy each snapshot row's irr onto the matching position, using the SAME join the original
-- backfill used: same fund, entity, vehicle-matched-by-name, and the snapshot's as_of_date
-- (falling back to its created date). Non-destructive: only fills positions whose irr is still
-- null, so any IRR entered by hand or re-imported later is preserved. Where two snapshots map to
-- the same (vehicle, entity, date), the most recently created snapshot's IRR wins — consistent
-- with the "later import wins" rule the position backfill used.
--
-- LEDGER VEHICLES ARE EXCLUDED. A vehicle whose capital_source is 'ledger' reads its capital from
-- posted journal entries and ignores lp_positions entirely, so an IRR on its (stray) positions
-- would never be shown and shouldn't be written. Today those are Bluefish SPV and Bluefish SPV
-- Associates; keying off capital_source rather than names keeps it correct as that set changes.
