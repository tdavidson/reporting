-- Backfill associate/GP member carry from the OLD model into the NEW one.
--
-- The old "GP Entity Ownership" table on the LPs page stored each associate member's carry in
-- lp_associates_overrides.carried_interest_pct, keyed by FREE-TEXT names (investor_entity,
-- associates_entity). The new carry tables on /funds/capital-accounts read carry from
-- partner_allocation_terms (category 'carried_interest', weight_override), keyed by IDS —
-- vehicle_id (the associate's fund_vehicles row) and lp_entity_id (the member). Because the
-- rebuild switched key models, associates that had carry configured on the old page came up
-- BLANK in the new carry table. This copies the old percentages across.
--
-- carryPct in the new model is DERIVED by normalizing each member's weight within the associate,
-- so the stored unit is irrelevant — copying carried_interest_pct straight into weight_override
-- preserves the relative split (two members at 50/50, or at 0.5/0.5, both derive to 50%).
--
-- Safety:
--   * Non-destructive — a member whose carry weight is ALREADY set is never overwritten, so any
--     carry entered directly in the new table wins.
--   * Names are matched case- and whitespace-insensitively; associate → fund_vehicles(kind
--     associate|gp), member → lp_entities(entity_name).
--   * Rows whose names don't resolve are skipped and reported via NOTICE — set those by hand.
--   * DISTINCT ON dedupes multiple old rows that resolve to the same (vehicle, member), keeping
--     the most recently updated, so the single-statement ON CONFLICT can't hit a row twice.
