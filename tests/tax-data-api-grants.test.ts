// The guardrail on who may reach partner tax data, and how.
//
// Every table below is served exclusively through a route gated on the `lp_capital` domain and
// the `tax_reporting` feature (lib/access/route-domains.ts), and read there with
// createAdminClient(). That is the whole access story — which means a stray Data API grant is
// not a second, weaker door: it is a door with no lock, because the grants know nothing about
// domains or features. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ships to the browser, so
// `grant select ... to authenticated` on k1_lines hands every partner's K-1 figures to a fund
// member the middleware refuses, from the console, with no route involved.
//
// The repo's own table template (CLAUDE.md) grants `authenticated` full CRUD, which is right for
// an ordinary table and wrong for these — so the mistake is one step away at all times, and a
// convention nothing enforces is a convention that decays. Same shape as books.test.ts and
// route-domains.test.ts: read the migrations, fail on anything that widened.
