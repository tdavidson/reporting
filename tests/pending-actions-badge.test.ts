/**
 * The badge used to count every pending row in the fund. Two things were wrong with that, and the
 * smaller one is the one that sounds worse: it was admin-only, so a member with grants opened a
 * queue they were never told had anything in it. The other is that an admin's count included rows
 * in domains a fund-level switch had turned OFF for everyone, so the badge promised a queue that
 * the page then refused to show.
 *
 * Both come from the same mistake — counting rows without asking who is looking.
