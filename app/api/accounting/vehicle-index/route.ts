// GET — the fund's active vehicles as { name, id, kind }, for the fund switcher and the sidebar's
// entity-first links. Distinct from /api/accounting/vehicles (names only), which external API
// keys and MCP configs already depend on and must keep its string[] shape.
//
// Management companies join the list only for a caller who holds `management_company`, checked
// here — the same rule /api/accounting/firm applies, and applied the same way: by ASKING, on top
// of the shared list rather than inside it. `listVehiclesWithId` still excludes them
// unconditionally, which is what keeps every other surface in the app unable to resolve one by
// accident (tests/manco-vehicle-domain.test.ts pins that).
//
// They belong here now because a management company is an entity in the Entities section like any
// other: the switcher jumps between entities, and the sidebar reads `kind` from this list to know
// which pages an entity has — without it a manco would be offered a fund's capital accounts.
