// POST — void many DRAFT entries at once (the journal's bulk-discard action). Same body,
// same paging and the same guards as bulk-post; see lib/accounting/journal-bulk.ts.

// Draft-only, deliberately. A draft has never touched the ledger, so voiding it discards a
// note-to-self. Voiding a POSTED entry reverses real balances, and that stays a one-at-a-time
// act through the PATCH route where the operator sees the entry they're reversing.
//
// Balance is NOT a condition here (unlike posting): an out-of-balance draft is exactly the
// kind you want to be able to throw away. A closed period still blocks it.
