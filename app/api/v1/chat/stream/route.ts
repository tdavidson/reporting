/**
 * Streaming chat (Phase 5), as Server-Sent Events.
 *
 * COARSE EVENTS. There is no `message.delta` here: the provider abstraction resolves a whole
 * result from every method, so no incremental text exists to forward without reshaping
 * `AIProvider` and every caller of it. What IS available — and is where nearly all the waiting
 * actually happens — is tool progress, because the orchestrator supplies the tool executor. So a
 * client sees the run start, sees each lookup begin and finish, and then receives the complete
 * answer. `lib/api-v1/stream.ts` documents how a later version adds deltas without breaking this.
 *
 * A DROPPED CONNECTION CANNOT REPEAT A WRITE, and not because of anything here: chat only ever
 * STAGES an action. Applying one is a separate authenticated call through the pending-action
 * service, which claims the row before executing and replays a completed approval under the same
 * `Idempotency-Key`. That property must not be traded away by ever executing from this route.
 *
 * Errors BEFORE the stream opens are ordinary v1 JSON envelopes with a real status code — an
 * unauthenticated caller should get 401, not a 200 whose body says 401. Once the stream is open the
 * status is already sent, so a failure becomes a terminal `error` event instead.
