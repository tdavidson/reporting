 * GET — the management company dashboard, in one request. `?group=<manco>&start=&end=`
 *
 * Cash, the quarterly revenue/expense cycle, the expense breakdown, the intercompany balances and
 * the charge register all in one payload, because they are one screen and four round trips to
 * render it is four chances for it to half-load.
 *
 * DEFAULT WINDOW: the trailing eight quarters, ending today. Two years is the shortest window in
 * which a quarterly cycle reads as a cycle — one year is four points, and four points do not show
 * you that last Q3's fee never arrived. It ends today rather than at the last closed period because
 * this is an operating view: a firm looking at its own cash wants this month included, unclosed.
