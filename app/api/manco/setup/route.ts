/**
 * POST — seed a management company's chart of accounts. Body: { group }
 *
 * The manco equivalent of /api/accounting/turn-on, and deliberately much smaller than it. That
 * route also creates a capital account per committed partner, carries a pasted LP snapshot in as
 * opening balances, and flips the vehicle's capital source to the ledger — every one of which is
 * about LPs, and a management company has none. What is left is the chart, so that is all this does.
 *
 * Additive and idempotent, like the accounting chart seeder: it creates what is missing and touches
 * nothing that exists, so it is also how an already-set-up manco picks up an account added to
 * MANAGEMENT_COMPANY_CHART later. Running it twice is a no-op, which matters because the landing
 * page offers the button whenever the chart looks incomplete.
