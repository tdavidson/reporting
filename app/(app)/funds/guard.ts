/**
 * Server-side gate for the Entities section. The sidebar visibility flag is cosmetic — hidden
 * features are still reachable by URL — so every page in the section enforces access here.
 * Resolves the caller's fund or redirects away.
 *
 * It asks the ONE resolver, and that is the whole point. This used to admit `admin|viewer` by role
 * and never look at the `accounting` grant, which made the grant a lie in one direction: a fund
 * that set Fund accounting to "Members" and granted someone write watched every accounting API
 * serve them while every accounting PAGE redirected them to the dashboard. That is the exact
 * contradiction tests/route-gates-honour-grants.test.ts was written to end on the route side —
 * "a second, coarser, contradictory policy is not defence in depth."
 *
 * What the resolver answers, and why each case is right:
 *   - admin, accounting on   → write. Unchanged.
 *   - admin, accounting off  → NONE, and now redirected. Previously the pages rendered and every
 *                              API on them 403'd, because the middleware already resolved this way.
 *   - viewer (the read-only demo) → read, so the demo still SHOWS the books. Writes are refused
 *                              downstream by assertAdminAccess, which rejects viewer.
 *   - member with the grant  → admitted, which is what granting it meant.
 *   - member without         → redirected, as before.
 *
 * This is the gate for pages that are not about ONE entity — the landing, and the firm-wide
 * landing for each section. A page that names an entity uses `requireVehicleAccess` below, which
 * asks this question and then one more.

/**
 * THE GATE FOR A PAGE ABOUT ONE ENTITY — which grant it needs is decided by the ENTITY, not by
 * the page.
 *
 * Every other page gate in this app answers "may this caller open this page?", and the answer is
 * the same whichever row the page then renders. The entity pages are the one place that isn't
 * true. A management company keeps its books in the same `journal_entries`, `journal_postings`
 * and `chart_of_accounts` rows as every fund, separated only by `vehicle_id`, so
 * `/funds/<the manco>/journal` is — to a gate that only reads the path — the same page as
 * `/funds/<Fund II>/journal`. One resolves `accounting`, sees a grant, and renders the firm's
 * payroll.
 *
 * So this is the page twin of `assertVehicleDomain` (lib/accounting/vehicle-domain.ts), and it is
 * deliberately the same shape: the check lives INSIDE the call every entity page already has to
 * make to find out which vehicle it is showing, so a new page under `/funds/[id]` cannot render
 * an entity without having asked. That is why it resolves the vehicle rather than taking one, and
 * why it returns the kind instead of a bare name.
 *
 * The rule, in full:
 *   - Any entity page needs `accounting`. These are the accounting views and they call
 *     `/api/accounting/*`, which the middleware gates on it; admitting someone without it would
 *     render a page whose every request 403s.
 *   - A management company needs `management_company` AS WELL. The conjunction errs safe:
 *     `accounting` alone can never reach a manco, which is the whole reason the domain was split.
 *
 * PAGE_DOMAINS records these pages as `accounting` because that is the minimum to open one —
 * the registry maps one domain per page, and the extra half of a page that straddles two is
 * gated here, in the page's own path. See lib/access/page-domains.ts.
