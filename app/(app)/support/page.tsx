            This platform is designed to automate the collection, parsing, and tracking of portfolio
            company reports. Instead of manually copying numbers out of emails and spreadsheets,
            the system uses AI to extract metrics from whatever format your companies send &mdash;
            emails, PDFs, Excel workbooks, slide decks, images &mdash; and writes the data directly
            into each company&apos;s metrics history.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The fastest way to get data flowing is to forward reporting emails to the inbound address
            shown in Settings. You can forward emails yourself, or give the inbound address to your
            founders or fund analysts and ask them to CC or send reports directly. Every email that
            arrives at that address is automatically parsed: the system identifies which company it&apos;s
            from, extracts the metrics you&apos;ve defined, and flags anything it&apos;s unsure about
            for your review.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Not everything arrives by email. When someone sends you a link to a Google Sheet, Google
            Slides, Docsend deck, or any other hosted file, download it and upload it through the
            Import page. The same goes for PDFs, Excel workbooks, Word docs, PowerPoint decks, CSVs,
            and images &mdash; anything you can download, you can import. The AI pipeline processes
            uploads identically to inbound emails.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Once data starts flowing, the Portfolio dashboard gives you a real-time view of every
            company, the Review queue catches anything that needs a human decision, and the Analyst
            on each company page synthesizes the data into actionable summaries. The goal is to spend
            less time on data entry and more time on the analysis and conversations that matter.

          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The Portfolio page is the main dashboard and your starting point for monitoring the fund.
            It shows all active companies with key headline metrics (such as MRR and cash balance) so you
            can quickly scan the health of the portfolio without clicking into individual companies.
            Companies are displayed as cards with their most recently reported figures.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Click any company card to open its detail page. The detail page shows historical metric
            charts, the Analyst summary, uploaded documents, and a notes panel. You can track how
            metrics have trended over time, upload supplementary documents (board decks, strategy memos,
            etc.) to give the AI more context, and generate or regenerate AI summaries on demand.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            At the top of each company page you&apos;ll see headline numbers and metadata like industry,
            stage, and any tags your team has applied. Admins can edit company details, add or remove
            metrics, and manage aliases (alternative names) that help the system match inbound emails
            to the right company.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The dashboard also includes a shared notes section at the bottom where team members can post
            fund-level observations &mdash; market commentary, cross-portfolio themes, reminders for the
            next IC meeting, and so on. These notes are visible to everyone on the team.

            Company Detail
          </h3>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Clicking a company on the Portfolio dashboard opens its detail page. At the top you&apos;ll
            see the company name, headline metrics (like MRR and cash balance), and badges for stage,
            industry, and portfolio groups. Admins can click the edit button to update the company&apos;s
            name, aliases, stage, industry, founders, overview, and other details that give the AI more
            context for analysis.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The main content area starts with the <strong>Analyst</strong> card. This is where you
            can generate an AI-powered summary of the company based on all available data &mdash; reported
            metrics, email content, uploaded documents, and any previous summaries. The AI acts as a
            senior analyst preparing a portfolio review memo: it highlights current performance, trends,
            strengths, risks, and follow-up questions. You can regenerate the summary at any time as new
            data comes in, clear it to start fresh, or upload additional context documents (board decks,
            strategy memos, investor updates) directly from this card to give the AI more to work with.
            If your fund has multiple AI providers configured, a provider selector lets you choose
            which AI to use for each generation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Below the Analyst is the <strong>metrics section</strong>, where each metric has its own
            chart card. You can add new metrics directly from this page using the &ldquo;Add metric&rdquo;
            button, or delete a metric and all its data from its card. Each chart shows data points over
            time, color-coded by confidence level (green for high, amber for medium, red for low) with
            manual entries shown as hollow circles. Click any data point on a chart to open a popover
            where you can view the full details &mdash; period, value, confidence, source email, and
            notes &mdash; and edit or delete the value directly. You can also add data points manually
            using the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button on each card, which is useful for entering historical data
            or correcting values. An export button at the top lets you download all metric data as a CSV.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Further down the page, a <strong>documents section</strong> lists all files associated with
            the company &mdash; both files you&apos;ve uploaded and attachments from processed emails.
            These documents are available to the Analyst when generating summaries. Individual file
            uploads are limited to 20 MB per file. Finally, if the company has additional details like founders,
            contact emails, an overview, investment thesis, or a current business update, those appear
            at the bottom. A <strong>notes panel</strong> on
            the right side (or toggled via the chat button on mobile) lets your team leave company-specific
            observations visible to all members.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The company page also includes an <strong>Investments</strong> section that tracks the
            fund&apos;s transaction history with that company. You can record investment rounds (with
            date, round name, amount invested, shares acquired, and cost per share), proceeds from
            exits or distributions (including escrowed amounts), and unrealized gain changes (current
            share price updates). The section displays summary metrics &mdash; total invested, current
            fair market value, MOIC, and total realized &mdash; along with a detailed transaction
            table. Admins can add, edit, and delete transactions directly from this panel. For exited
            companies the FMV reflects total realized proceeds; for written-off companies it shows zero;
            and for active companies it uses the latest share price multiplied by total shares held.

            Review
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            When inbound emails are processed, the AI pipeline sometimes flags items that need a human
            decision. These flagged items appear in the Review queue. Common reasons include: a new
            company name was detected that doesn&apos;t match any existing portfolio company, a metric
            value was extracted with low confidence, a reporting period was ambiguous, or a metric
            couldn&apos;t be found in the report at all.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Each review item shows you the issue type, the extracted value (if any), and a snippet of
            context from the source email so you can make an informed decision. You can accept the
            extracted value as-is, reject it, or manually correct it with the right number. For new
            company detections, you can create the company or map it to an existing one.

            The review badge in the sidebar shows how many items are waiting for attention. Once all
            review items for a given email are resolved, that email&apos;s status automatically moves
            from &ldquo;needs review&rdquo; to &ldquo;success.&rdquo; You can also dismiss all review
            items for an email at once if the entire report should be skipped.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Staying on top of the review queue is important &mdash; it&apos;s how you ensure the
            data flowing into your portfolio metrics is accurate. The system is designed to err on the
            side of flagging rather than silently writing bad data.

            Inbound
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Inbound shows every email that has been received and processed by the system. It&apos;s the
            audit trail for all automated report ingestion. Each row displays the sender, subject line,
            which company the email was matched to, and the processing status (success, needs review,
            failed, processing, or pending).
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            You can filter the list by status and date range to quickly find specific emails. Filters
            apply immediately as you change them. The list is paginated and sorted by most recent first,
            so new emails always appear at the top.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Clicking on any email opens its detail view. There you&apos;ll see the full processing
            result: which company was identified, which metrics were extracted and their values, the
            reporting period that was detected, and any review items that were created. The raw email
            body and attachment information are also available for reference.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            If an email failed processing (for example, the AI key was misconfigured or the email
            content was unreadable), you can see the error message in the detail view. For emails
            stuck in &ldquo;needs review,&rdquo; you can open the review modal directly from the
            Inbound page to resolve flagged items without navigating to the Review queue.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The platform can also store documents for you automatically. If your admin has connected
            Google Drive or Dropbox in Settings, every inbound email and its attachments are saved
            into company-specific folders &mdash; organized by company name &mdash; so you always have
            the original source files alongside the extracted data.

            Clicking on any email in the Inbound list opens its detail page. At the top you&apos;ll
            see the subject line, sender address, received date, processing status badge, and the
            company the email was matched to (if identified). If processing failed, an error message
            explains what went wrong.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Below that, the page shows the metrics that were extracted &mdash; a table with each
            metric name, the reporting period, the extracted value, and a confidence indicator (high,
            medium, or low). If there are unresolved review items for this email, they appear next
            with their issue type, context snippet, and action buttons so you can accept, reject,
            edit, or dismiss each one. For new company detections, you can create the company directly
            from this page.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The detail page also lists any attachments that came with the email (with filename, type,
            and size), the raw email body text, and a collapsible view of the AI&apos;s full response
            for debugging or reference.

            Two actions are available at the bottom. <strong>Process Email</strong> lets you rerun the
            entire AI pipeline on this email &mdash; useful if you&apos;ve since added the company to
            your portfolio, updated metric definitions, or changed AI providers. It will replace any
            existing extracted metrics and review items with fresh results. If file storage is
            connected, a <strong>Save to File Storage</strong> button lets you manually push the email
            and its attachments to your Google Drive or Dropbox, organized into the appropriate company
            folder.

            Import
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Import lets you process reports manually when they arrive outside the normal email flow.
            You can paste email text directly, upload file attachments (PDFs, Excel spreadsheets, Word
            documents, PowerPoint decks, CSV files, and images up to 20 MB each), paste email text directly, or combine both. The system runs the
            same AI pipeline as automated inbound processing &mdash; identifying the company, extracting
            metrics, and writing results to the database.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            This is useful for several scenarios: reports received through Slack or other messaging tools,
            historical data you want to backfill from older files, reports forwarded from colleagues
            outside the authorized sender list, or situations where you want to re-extract data from a
            document with updated metrics definitions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            When you submit an import, the system processes it identically to an inbound email. The
            result appears in the Inbound list with the same status tracking, and any flagged items
            show up in the Review queue. You can import multiple reports in sequence without waiting
            for each one to finish.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            You can also paste data that covers multiple companies at once &mdash; for example, rows copied
            from a spreadsheet or CSV file containing metrics across your portfolio. The system will parse
            the data, create new companies if they don&apos;t already exist, add new metrics as needed, and
            populate values for existing companies and metrics. This makes it easy to bulk import historical
            data or onboard an entire portfolio in one step.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Additionally, you can paste investment transaction data &mdash; rounds, proceeds, valuations,
            and share prices &mdash; and the AI will parse the entries and match them to your portfolio
            companies. This is useful for bulk-importing cap table history, backfilling historical rounds,
            or onboarding an entire portfolio&apos;s investment data at once. Transactions are written to
            each company&apos;s Investments section automatically.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            You can also paste fund-level cash flow data &mdash; commitments, capital calls, and
            distributions per portfolio group. Each row uses the format: date, group, type, amount,
            notes (optional). Type accepts full names (commitment, called_capital, distribution)
            or abbreviations (com, cc, dist). These cash flows power the computed LP metrics
            (TVPI, DPI, RVPI, Net IRR) shown on the Funds and Investments pages.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Tip: for best results, include the company name and reporting period somewhere in the pasted
            text or attachment. The AI uses these cues to match the report to the correct company and
            assign the right period to extracted metrics.

            Asks
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Asks lets you send reporting request emails to your portfolio companies. This is how you
            kick off a reporting cycle &mdash; compose a message asking companies to send in their latest
            numbers, select which companies should receive it, and send it out. The system tracks each
            request so you know what was sent and when.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The email composer supports a customizable subject and HTML body. You can write a standard
            template that you reuse each quarter, or tailor messages for specific companies. Emails are
            sent through whichever outbound email provider your admin has configured (Gmail, Resend,
            Postmark, or Mailgun).
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Each request is logged with its recipient list, send timestamp, and delivery results. You
            can view past requests to see the full history of reporting asks. This is helpful for
            tracking which companies have been contacted and following up with those that haven&apos;t
            responded.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            When companies reply to your ask email with their report, those replies flow into the
            Inbound pipeline automatically (assuming the sender is on the authorized senders list and
            replies to the configured inbound address). The full loop &mdash; ask, receive, parse,
            review &mdash; is designed to work end to end with minimal manual effort.

            Settings is where the platform is configured. Most settings are admin-only, but all users
            can update their display name (shown on notes and activity) and enable two-factor
            authentication for additional account security.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            For admins, Settings covers the full platform configuration: AI provider keys and model
            selection (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and/or Ollama for local models), the default AI provider
            for the fund, feature visibility controls, inbound email setup (Postmark or Mailgun), outbound email
            providers (Gmail, Resend, Postmark, or Mailgun), file storage connections (Google Drive or Dropbox),
            the AI summary prompt, and email templates for reporting asks.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Admins also manage the authorized senders list (email addresses allowed to submit reports
            via the inbound pipeline), team members and their roles, and an allow-list that controls
            who can sign up for the platform. A danger zone at the bottom allows admins to permanently
            delete all fund data if needed.

            Notes
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Notes are available in three places: on each company&apos;s detail page, on the Portfolio
            dashboard, and on the dedicated Notes page. They provide a lightweight way for team members
            to share observations, context, and follow-up items without leaving the platform.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            On a company detail page, the notes panel appears on the right side on desktop or can be
            toggled via a chat button on mobile. Notes here are specific to that company &mdash; use
            them for takeaways from founder calls, questions to raise at the next board meeting, context
            on a metric anomaly, or anything else your team should know about that particular investment.
            On the Portfolio dashboard, the shared notes section is for fund-level observations that
            apply across the portfolio: market trends, cross-company themes, reminders for the next
            investment committee, or general team updates.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The Notes page is a centralized feed that collects all notes across the fund in one place.
            You can filter by All notes, General (fund-level) notes, or just notes where you were
            @mentioned. Each note shows the author, timestamp, and which company it belongs to (if any),
            with unread notes highlighted so you can quickly catch up on what you&apos;ve missed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Notes support <strong>@mentions</strong> &mdash; type <strong>@</strong> while writing a note
            to see a dropdown of team members, then select a name to mention them. Mentioned team members
            are highlighted in the note text and can receive email notifications depending on their
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            You can also <strong>follow companies</strong> to stay informed about notes posted on companies
            you care about, even if you aren&apos;t directly mentioned. When someone posts a note on a
            company you follow, you&apos;ll receive a notification.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Notification preferences are managed in <strong>Settings</strong> under your user profile.
            You can choose to receive email notifications for all notes across the fund, only when you
            are @mentioned, or turn notifications off entirely. Company follows work alongside whichever
            level you choose &mdash; if you follow a company, you&apos;ll get notified about notes on
            that company regardless of your global setting.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            All notes show the author&apos;s display name and timestamp. Team members can edit or
            delete their own notes. Notes are visible to everyone on the team, so they work well as a
            lightweight internal communication tool alongside your existing workflows.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Interactions gives GPs a searchable log of all conversations and introductions with portfolio
            companies. When a GP BCCs the fund&apos;s inbound email address on a conversation, the system
            automatically detects that the sender is a fund member, classifies the email as a CRM interaction
            (not a metrics report), and uses AI to extract a summary and identify any introductions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The classification is automatic: emails from fund members are routed to the interaction pipeline,
            while emails from authorized senders (portfolio companies) continue through the existing metrics
            extraction pipeline. No manual tagging is required.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            For each interaction, the AI generates a short summary, detects whether the email contains an
            introduction between parties, and extracts the names and context of anyone being introduced.
            Interactions are linked to portfolio companies when possible, so you can see all conversations
            related to a specific company.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The Interactions page shows all logged interactions across the fund, with filter tabs
            for <strong>All</strong> and <strong>Intros</strong>. Each entry shows the date, linked company,
            subject line, AI summary, and an intro badge when introductions were detected. Click the intro
            details to expand and see the names, emails, and context of introduced contacts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            On each company&apos;s detail page, a <strong>Recent Interactions</strong> section shows the
            latest interactions for that company, with intro entries highlighted in a distinct style. A
            &ldquo;View all&rdquo; link takes you to the full interactions list filtered to that company.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The fund&apos;s inbound email address is displayed at the top of the Interactions page for

            The Investments page provides a fund-level view of all investment transactions across your portfolio.
            It aggregates data from each company&apos;s individual Investments section into a single table,
            showing total invested, current fair market value (FMV), MOIC, and total realized across the entire fund.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            On each <strong>company detail page</strong>, the Investments section tracks the fund&apos;s transaction
            history with that specific company. You can record investment rounds (with date, round name, amount invested,
            shares acquired, and cost per share), proceeds from exits or distributions (including escrowed amounts),
            and unrealized gain changes (current share price updates). Summary metrics &mdash; total invested,
            current FMV, MOIC, and total realized &mdash; are displayed above the transaction table.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Admins can add, edit, and delete transactions directly. For exited companies the FMV reflects total
            realized proceeds; for written-off companies it shows zero; and for active companies it uses the latest
            share price multiplied by total shares held. Investment data can also be bulk-imported via the
            Import page by pasting transaction data from a spreadsheet.

            The Funds page provides fund-level LP metrics computed from cash flow data. Each portfolio
            group gets its own tab showing committed capital, called capital (paid-in capital), uncalled
            capital, distributions, gross residual value, estimated carry, net residual value, and total
            value &mdash; along with calculated TVPI, DPI, RVPI, and Net IRR.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Cash flows are recorded per portfolio group with three types: <strong>commitments</strong> (capital
            committed by LPs), <strong>called capital</strong> (capital actually called from LPs), and
            <strong> distributions</strong> (capital returned to LPs). Each tab shows a chronological table
            of cash flows with running cumulative totals for committed, called, uncalled, and distributed amounts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The LP metrics are calculated automatically: TVPI (total value to paid-in capital), DPI (distributions
            to paid-in capital), RVPI (net residual value to paid-in capital), and Net IRR (using XIRR with
            capital calls as negative flows, distributions as positive, and net residual as a terminal value).
            Estimated carry is computed as 20% of profit above remaining invested capital.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Cash flows can be added individually from the Funds page or bulk-imported via the Import page
            by pasting tab or comma-separated data. The same computed metrics also appear in the group summary
            table on the Investments page.

            Letters helps you generate quarterly update letters for your limited partners.
            Using AI and your portfolio data &mdash; reported metrics, company summaries, investment
            performance, and team notes &mdash; the system drafts professional LP communications
            scoped to a specific portfolio group and reporting period.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Creating a letter</strong> &mdash; click &ldquo;New letter&rdquo; and select the year,
            quarter, portfolio group, and template. Optionally toggle &ldquo;year-end summary&rdquo; for
            Q4 letters and add custom instructions to guide the AI. A preview step shows the companies
            and data that will be included before generation begins.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Templates</strong> &mdash; upload a previous LP letter (.docx or .pdf) and AI analyzes
            it to match your writing style, tone, and structure. Or use the built-in default template.
            Templates are reusable across letters and managed from the Templates dialog on the Letters page.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Generation</strong> &mdash; the AI generates a narrative for each company in the portfolio
            group, drawing on reported metrics, recent trends, company summaries, investment data, and team
            notes. A portfolio summary table with investment performance is also generated. The full letter
            is assembled from these sections.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Editing</strong> &mdash; after generation, the letter opens in an editor with two views:
            &ldquo;Sections&rdquo; shows each company narrative individually for targeted editing,
            and &ldquo;Full&rdquo; shows the complete assembled letter. Edit narratives inline, regenerate
            individual company sections or the entire letter, and add per-company or global custom prompts
            to refine the output. Per-company prompts can either add to or replace the default generation prompt.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            <strong>Export</strong> &mdash; export the finished letter as a .docx file for final formatting
            and distribution. If Google Drive is connected, you can export directly to Drive.

            LPs helps you track and report on your limited partner positions across snapshots. Import LP data
            from spreadsheets, view aggregated metrics per investor, generate individual investor reports as PDFs,
            and export the full dataset to Excel.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The LPs index page lists all snapshots and provides fund-level configuration for GP Entity Ownership mappings.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              Each snapshot represents LP positions at a point in time &mdash; typically a quarter-end.
              Create a new snapshot, then import data by pasting spreadsheet content. AI automatically
              matches columns to fields like investor name, entity, commitment, paid-in capital,
              distributions, NAV, DPI, RVPI, TVPI, and IRR.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              <strong>Investor table</strong> &mdash; the snapshot detail page shows all investors with
              aggregated metrics. Expand an investor to see individual entity and portfolio group line items.
              All values are inline-editable: click a row to edit metrics, or click an investor name to rename.
              Investors can be grouped under a parent for consolidated reporting.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              <strong>Portfolio group filter</strong> &mdash; when a snapshot has multiple portfolio groups,
              a filter appears in the header to include or exclude specific groups from the view and totals.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              <strong>Report settings</strong> &mdash; configure a header and footer for the snapshot&apos;s
              PDF reports via the Settings button. These appear on individual investor PDFs and batch exports.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              <strong>Investor PDFs</strong> &mdash; click the document icon on any investor row to view their
              individual report, or use &ldquo;Batch PDFs&rdquo; to generate all investor reports at once.
              PDFs include the header, a metrics summary table, and the footer.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              This optional section on the LPs index page lets you map investor entities to GP-managed entities
              (such as an associates or co-invest vehicle) and define ownership percentages. This is useful when
              individual investors own pro-rata shares of a GP entity that itself holds positions in the fund&apos;s
              portfolio groups.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
              For each mapping, specify the <strong>investor entity</strong> name, the <strong>associates entity</strong> name,
              and optionally an <strong>ownership percentage</strong> (if left blank, ownership is computed automatically
              from the investor&apos;s commitment relative to the total). You can also set a <strong>carried interest
              percentage</strong> to reduce the investor&apos;s pro-rata share by the GP&apos;s carry on gains.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              After configuring mappings, use the <strong>Recalculate</strong> button on any snapshot detail page
              to compute and upsert the pro-rata investment metrics for each mapped investor. This persists across
              snapshots &mdash; configure once, then recalculate on each new snapshot.

            Usage is an <strong>admin-only</strong> page that shows how your fund is consuming AI tokens

          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The top section displays <strong>AI token usage</strong> broken down by provider (Anthropic,
            OpenAI, Gemini, and/or Ollama), with month-to-date totals for input tokens, output tokens, and estimated cost.
            Ollama usage is tracked but shown at zero cost since it runs locally.
            A daily breakdown table shows usage by model, so you can see exactly where tokens are being
            spent &mdash; email processing, metric extraction, company identification, summaries, or
            analyst conversations.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The bottom section shows <strong>team activity</strong>: a summary of actions per team member
            (logins, company updates, imports, notes, reviews resolved) and a recent activity feed with
            timestamps. This gives admins visibility into how the platform is being used across the team.

            Analyst
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The Analyst is an interactive chat interface available on every page. Powered by AI, it acts as a senior
            venture capital analyst with full access to your portfolio data, answering questions, surfacing
            insights, and helping you prepare for board meetings and investment committee discussions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            On a <strong>company page</strong>, the Analyst has access to that company&apos;s reported metrics,
            email content, uploaded documents, previous AI summaries, investment transaction history, portfolio
            peer comparisons, and your team&apos;s internal discussion notes. You can ask it to analyze
            performance trends, compare the company to peers, identify risks, draft or refine summaries,
            interpret financial data from reports, or answer any question about the company&apos;s data.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            On <strong>portfolio-wide pages</strong> (Portfolio, Investments, Asks, Notes), the Analyst has
            access to fund-level data across all companies &mdash; investment amounts, FMV, MOIC, and your
            team&apos;s discussion notes. Use it to compare companies, get portfolio-level insights, or ask
            about cross-portfolio trends and themes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Conversations are persistent.</strong> Your chat history is saved to your account and
            stored in the database. You can close the panel, navigate to other pages, or close the browser
            entirely &mdash; when you return, click the clock icon to open your conversation history and
            resume any previous thread. Conversations are scoped by context: company-specific chats stay
            with that company, and portfolio-wide chats have their own history.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Conversation memory</strong> gives the Analyst continuity across sessions. When you
            start a new conversation, the system automatically summarizes your recent past conversations
            in the same context and injects those summaries into the AI&apos;s prompt. This means the
            Analyst remembers what you&apos;ve discussed before &mdash; key questions, conclusions, and
            concerns &mdash; without you needing to repeat context.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Team notes as context:</strong> The Analyst incorporates your team&apos;s internal
            discussion notes into its analysis. Notes posted on a company page are included when chatting
            about that company, and portfolio-wide notes are included in fund-level conversations. This
            means the AI is aware of your team&apos;s observations, follow-up items, and qualitative
            context alongside the quantitative data.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            Use the header controls to manage conversations: the <strong>clock icon</strong> opens your
            conversation history, the <strong>plus icon</strong> starts a new conversation, and you can
            delete old conversations from the history list. If your fund has both Anthropic and OpenAI
            configured, a model selector lets you choose which AI to use.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            The Analyst can also save its responses directly as company summaries using the &ldquo;Save
            as Summary&rdquo; button that appears below each response on company pages. This lets you
            use the chat to iteratively refine a summary and then commit it to the company&apos;s record
            with one click.

            File Handling &amp; Security
          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The platform accepts a wide range of file types for processing: PDFs, Excel spreadsheets
            (.xlsx, .xls), Word documents (.docx), PowerPoint presentations (.pptx), CSV files, and
            images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP). Files can be uploaded through the Import page, attached to
            inbound emails, or uploaded directly to a company&apos;s documents section.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>File size limits:</strong> Individual file uploads are limited to 20 MB per file. This applies
            to both manual uploads and email attachments. For larger files (such as high-resolution board
            decks or extensive spreadsheets), consider splitting them into smaller parts, compressing images,
            or exporting to a more compact format before uploading. The AI processing pipeline works best
            with focused, well-structured documents rather than very large omnibus files.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Text extraction:</strong> The system extracts text content from uploaded files to make
            them available to the AI for analysis and metric extraction. PDFs and Office documents have
            their text extracted server-side. Images are processed using the AI&apos;s vision capabilities
            to read charts, tables, and text directly from screenshots or photos of reports.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>Virus and safety screening:</strong> The platform does not currently include built-in
            antivirus or malware scanning of uploaded files. Files are stored in your configured storage
            provider (Supabase Storage, Google Drive, or Dropbox), which may provide their own scanning
            capabilities depending on your plan and configuration. If your organization requires virus
            scanning, we recommend configuring it at the storage provider level or scanning files before
            uploading them to the platform.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            <strong>File storage:</strong> When file storage is configured (Google Drive or Dropbox),
            email attachments and uploaded documents are automatically organized into company-specific
            folders. This provides a backup of all source materials alongside the extracted data. Files
            stored in Supabase Storage are accessible through the platform&apos;s UI; files in Google
            Drive or Dropbox can also be accessed directly through those services.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            <strong>Data privacy:</strong> Uploaded files and their extracted content are only accessible
            to members of your fund. Row-level security policies ensure that users can only see data
            belonging to their fund. File content sent to AI providers (Anthropic or OpenAI) for processing
            is subject to those providers&apos; data handling policies &mdash; refer to their documentation

          </h2>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The platform includes a built-in update checker that compares your installed version against

          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
            The Updates page shows your current version, the latest available version, release notes, and
            a link to the GitHub release. The check runs automatically and is cached for one hour, so
            it does not slow down normal usage.

          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Each installation has a unique <strong className="text-foreground">Installation ID</strong> &mdash;
            a UUID generated automatically in your database. This ID is specific to your deployment and is
            shown at the bottom of the Updates page. Only admins can see the Updates page; non-admin users

            At the bottom of the sidebar you&apos;ll find two utility controls. The theme toggle cycles
            between System, Light, and Dark modes. System mode follows your operating system&apos;s
            preference, so if your OS switches to dark mode at night, the platform will follow
            automatically.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground">
            Below the theme toggle is the sidebar collapse button. Collapsing the sidebar reduces it
            to a narrow icon-only strip, giving you more horizontal space for content &mdash; especially
            useful on smaller screens or when viewing wide metric charts. Click the button again to
            expand the sidebar back to its full width. On mobile, the sidebar opens as a slide-over
            overlay and closes when you navigate or tap outside it.
